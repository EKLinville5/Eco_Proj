# Ecology Project 
Using the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) Database, an exploration of the populations of African Hunting Dogs (Lycaon pictus) and Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in select countries in Africa. Specifically, evidence for supporting the idea that these population densities are inversely proportional due to environmental and interdependent factors was explored.

## Packages that were used for analysis
rgbif, tidyverse, ggplot2, ggmap, dplyer, mapview, sp, raster, scrubr, maps

### Exploration of Data
The question of population densitiy relationships was the driving force behind this side project. Process of data analysis included determining appropriate data from database, cleaning and tidying the data, then performing basic visualization methods on the resulting data. In addition, spatial cleaning and organization, building data frames, running ecological statistics, and mapping spatial data were performed for each species, and then collectively.
